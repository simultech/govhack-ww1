The vehicle is a British Gun Carrier Mark I which were originally designed in 1916 to transport a 60 pounder field gun or a 6 inch howitzer across the battlefield after breakthrough had been achieved. Forty eight vehicles were manufactured in 1917 by Kitson and Company, Great Britain. As the allied breakthrough was not achieved in 1917, these vehicles were largely relegated to transporting supplies to infantry and artillery units. In this particular instance this Gun Carrier is taking supplies to a nearby infantry unit at Suzanne Wood.",

This photograph was published in the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914-18, Volume III, The AIF in France 1916, page 460, with the following caption; \"The Somme battlefield seen in July 1916 from a British kite-balloon. The view is from near Bécourt, looking north-east to Bapaume.  The old British forward trenches occupy the foreground.  The blurred streak beyond is the German frontline, battered by the British bombardment.  The woods on the right are those of Fricourt, Mametz and Bazentin.  Fricourt is on the near side of the lowest wood, on the extreme right. Bapaume is barely visible, lying near the horizon in the centre; but the Roman road leading to it can be seen towards the top of the left half of the picture.”  The arrow identifying Martinpuich was removed from the reproduction in the official history.  This area of British operations immediately beyond Pozieres was subjected to attack on a wide front by British Divisions including the New Zealanders, the Guards, and on the Reserve Army front, the Canadians.  On 15 September 1916 the villages of Flers, Martinpuich and Courcelette were captured and following the attack on 25 September Morval, Lesboeufs, Combles and Gueudecourt  were taken.  On 26 September, in the Reserve Army sector, Thiepval and Mouquet Farm were also captured.",

The image shows the extent of the momentary German advance on 15 April 1917, when, attacking on a six mile front between Hermies and Noreuil, with Lagnicourt as the centre of the onslaught, the Germans succeeded in penetrating the Australian forward line.  They captured the guns of the 2nd Australian Field Artillery which had been brought to advanced positions and for two hours held them, until a rush of Australian troops retrieved the position and drove the German forces back to the village.  When the guns were recaptured it was found that of the twenty one pieces that had been in German possession, only five had been damaged.  Both sides took several hundred prisoners in this action, but the German losses were heavy and nothing was gained.  The shell damaged village of Lagnicourt is visible in the background (left).

An enemy artist had painted a scene on the front of the tank representing a German tank crushing a British lion. A British artist retaliated, as the picture shows, by reversing the idea\" (Official caption). At the 5th Tank Brigade demonstration ground, Vaux-en-Amienois, France, Australian soldiers inspect Mephisto, a German A7V tank.  After being bogged and abandoned on the battlefield it was recovered on 14 July 1918 by the 26th Battalion and a British Royal Armoured Corps unit.  After been recovered from the battlefield and studied by the Allies, Mephisto was handed over to the Australian War Records Section for despatch to Australia. On the front left of the tank, an unknown German artist had painted a figure representing a legendary Faustian demon known as ‘Mephisto’ (short for Mephistopheles) carrying away a British tank under his left arm. After recovery, an unknown Allied artist painted a large lion wearing a symbolic British Royal crown. Under its right paw, is an A7V tank.\n",

The gun with its 21 metre barrel and concrete foundations weighed more than 500 tons and could fire a one ton projectile at least 38 kilometres. It was the largest gun used to fire on Amiens and had been in action since early June 1917. The first barrel was worn out, a second was fitted and the gun was again in action on 7 August 1918. After firing only 35 shells it was destroyed by the Germans on the morning of the 8 August 1918. Although the general position of the gun was known it was discovered by Lance Corporals J.T. Conmee and J.N. Doughty and also independently by some men of Lieutenant Mitchell's platoon from the 1st Battalion. Arcy Wood was cleared of Germans on 23 August 1918 as the 1st, 2nd and 5th Australian Divisions, south of the River Somme pushed eastward away from Amiens and Villers-Bretonneux, in a series of decisive victories, which in August saw the front line pushed out to Chuignes.

Pte Pottinger, a native of London, England, was a labourer from Brighton SA prior to enlistment and embarked with the 4th Reinforcements from Adelaide on HMAT Star of England on 21 September 1915. After being wounded in action, he rejoined the Battalion and, on 2 March 1917, was killed in action, aged 32. Pte Reynolds, a miner from Kadina, SA prior to enlistment, embarked with the 10th Reinforcements from Adelaide on RMS Mongolia on 9 March 1916. He was killed in action aged 25, also on 2 March 1917. Following the Armistice their graves could not be relocated and both men are commemorated on the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial. This image is one of a set of photographs of the original graves of some members of the 27th Battalion. The Battalion funded the purchase of the camera through its adjutant Captain (Capt) Southon for 5541 Pte G R Barrington to photograph the graves.

This is one of a series of battlefield photographs taken by 13272 Private (Pte) Albert Victor Cooke, 12th  Field Ambulance. Pte Cooke carried a private camera, against regulations, during his service in France and Belgium and took several photographs of his unit in the front line and of damaged buildings. Several of these are reminiscent of photographs taken by better known Australian official photographers and often from similar vantage points. In this example, probably taken late in 1918, he has recreated Captain Frank Hurley's famous image taken from the same vantage point in November 1917 (see E01230). In the intervening period much of the wall in the foreground has collapsed and the remainder shored up. Grass and trees have begun to regrow and the military traffic in the former has been replaced by well dressed civilians in the latter.  It is not known if Cpl Cooke was aware of Hurley's photograph before he took this image but it is possible. Many of the Australian Official photographs had been published or exhibited in England by the end of the war and when chosing this angle Cooke may well have had Hurley's photograph E01230 in mind.

The image shows the extent of the momentary German advance on 15 April 1917, when, attacking on a six mile front between Hermies and Noreuil, with Lagnicourt as the centre of the onslaught, the Germans succeeded in penetrating the Australian forward line.  They captured the guns of the 2nd Australian Field Artillery, which had been brought to advanced positions, and for two hours held them until a rush of Australian troops retrieved the position and drove the German forces back to the village.  When the guns were recaptured it was found that of the twenty one pieces that had been in German possession, only five had been damaged.  Both sides took several hundred prisoners in this action, but the German losses were heavy and nothing was gained.  The shell damaged village of Lagnicourt is visible in the background (left).

They mixed together, fighting under each other's officers, until the Canadian Highlanders were well entrenched in the lines the Australians had won and held.  \"Nature, in her kindly mood, has hidden many a scar and many a grave on this historic and desolate area, which Australian valour and sacrifice has made a place of hallowed memory\".

The tank is from British unit No. 11 Company, D Battalion and took part in the Battle of Bullecourt on 11 April 1917. Although some sources claim this tank had penetrated as far as Riencourt and Hendecourt, it is now known to have been disabled near the German trench lines and left behind on the battlefield. This image, copied from a  German photographic postcard and taken soon after the battle, shows the significant shell damage sustained by the front of the tank. The sponson is camouflaged in a splinter pattern. Some sources indicate that a number of MkII tanks fitted with MkI sponsons were used in the attack. Cleats for improving traction over mud had been fitted to the tracks giving an irregular shape to them. ",

A 21 year old clerk prior to enlisting on 15 March 1916, he embarked for overseas as a Private (service number 2856) with the 7th Reinforcements from Adelaide on 6 November 1916 aboard HMAT Afric. Following further training in England, he joined the 50th Battalion in France in May 1917. Two months later, he was back in England undergoing officer training at Cambridge where he was appointed a Second Lieutenant on 3 November 1917. After rejoining the 50th Battalion in France later in November, he was wounded in action near Villers-Bretonneux on 6 May 1918. While undergoing medical treatment for his wounds, he was promoted to Lieutenant on 14 May 1918. He rejoined the 50th Battalion in June and was killed in action near Bray, France on 11 August 1918. Lt Bills is buried in the Bronfay Farm Military Cemetery, Bray-Sur-Somme, France. In 1923 brothers-in-law Thomas Fisher and Albert Harvey toured battlefields and war cemeteries and photographed graves of their relatives. ",

    "description": "The derelict hulk of a British tank on the Pozieres battlefield. This Mark I Male tank, C1, (Champagne), belonged to C Company, Heavy Machine Gun Corps, later to become the Tank Corps. It was one of seven tanks assigned to the Canadian 2nd and 3rd Divisions for their attack on Courcelette, and German positions to the south and east of the village on 15 September 1916. The 2nd Division attacked from prepared positions across the Albert to Bapaume road toward Bapaume and to the north of the road with the village of Courcelette as their first objective. Of the seven tanks assigned to the attack on Courcelette, one broke down before the attack, three became bogged in German trenches, two reached Courcelette, although only one was still in action beyond Courcelette. C1 was commanded by Lieutenant (Lt) A. G. C. Wheeler, Machine Gun Corps (MGC), and the crew from the MGC included, 2527 Sergeant F. J. Saker, 2801 Gunner (Gnr) E. H. Bax, 2720 Gnr W. N. Smith, 2736 Gnr F. C. Stone, 2602 Gnr G. G. Lloyd, 2752 Gnr H. Rothera and the driver M2/105514 Private (Pte) H. Brotherwood, Army Service Corps. Lt Wheeler and his crew reached their start position at 0400 on the extreme left of the divisional area after moving through the ruins of Pozieres. C1's steering had been damaged by German shellfire during the night and although this had been repaired the driver Pte Brotherwood must have had a very difficult time keeping the tank on track, avoiding old trenches, the many shell craters and the growing number of Canadian causalities falling in the tanks path. The terrain was so difficult that the tank could not keep up with the infantry and the speed was reduced to around 10 yards per minute until at about 0700 when the tank bellied out and although the tracks were still turning the tank had stopped. Lt Wheeler later placed the tank at map reference R35a 3.9. The crew tried to dig the tank out, but after laboring for four hours and just as Lt Wheeler was about to abandon the task, a shell landed nearby and a fragment severed Pte Brotherwood's jugular; he died two minutes later. The tank was abandoned on the battlefield. Pte Brotherwood is buried in the Pozieres cemetery. This action on 15 September 1916 at Flers and Courcelette was the first time tanks were used on the Western Front. The Tank Corps Memorial, commemorating this action, is near the Windmill site on the Albert to Bapaume Road, just to the east of Pozieres, not far from where this photograph was taken.

    "description": "An aerial view the Ovillers/La Boisselle battlefield with village of Becourt surrounded by trees in the foreground. The village of Pozieres, astride the Albert to Bapaume road, is marked by the arrow. This region was in the centre of the British area of the Somme battlefield and was heavily contested with great loss of life on both sides. The attack on Pozieres in July 1916 was largely undertaken by the men of 1 Anzac Corps, who had recently moved from the Armentieres sector, and was their first action in the Battle of the Somme. At this point the British strategy focused on the seizure of the ridge east of Pozières village from where an attack could be mounted on German strongholds further north at Thiepval which had not fallen to British attack on the opening day of the battle, 1 July 1916. By the time the Australians entered the Somme battle the operation had become a series of attacks aimed not so much at a break-through of the German lines as the capture of key positions and the wearing down of the enemy. Between 23 July and 5 August 1916, the Australian 1st and 2nd Divisions captured Pozières village and Pozières heights, a ridge 500 metres east of the village. The initial attack began at 12.30 am on Sunday 23 July when the 1st Division seized the German front line and in the following hour reached the main road through Pozières. At dawn the Germans counter-attacked but the Australians held on. The rest of Pozières fell on the night of 23–24 July and further gains were made on the night of 24–25 July. The Germans reacted to the seizure of Pozières by concentrating the bulk of their artillery on the Australians. Constant barrages were directed onto the village and the narrow approaches creating a nightmarish situation for troops forming up and attacking in the dark. By 27 July, the 2nd Division had taken over in Pozières.The 2nd Division was ordered to take Pozières heights. The attack commenced at 12.15 am on 29 July but the Germans were ready and the attack failed at a cost of 3,500 Australian casualties. The Australian commander of the 2nd Division asked that his men might attack again rather than be withdrawn after failure. Following an intense bombardment on 4 August 1916, the Australian seized Pozières heights. The exhausted 2nd Division was now rested and the 4th Division took up positions on the Pozières Heights. Attacking north along the ridge, the Australians in ten days of continuous action reached Mouquet Farm. The 4th Division was now relieved. The farm resisted capture until 26 September 1916. In less than seven weeks in the fighting at Pozières and Mouquet Farm three Australian divisions suffered 23,000 casualties. Of these, 6,800 men were killed or died of wounds. It was a loss comparable with the casualties sustained by the Australians over eight months at Gallipoli in 1915. The cost had been very large for both sides and in the words of Australian official historian Charles Bean, the Pozières ridge \"is more densely sown with Australian sacrifice than any other place on earth.\"  ",

Shortly after arriving in Egypt, he transferred to the 50th Battalion and reverted to the rank of Private. However, he was soon promoted to Corporal on 12 March 1916 and after arriving in France, was promoted to Lance Sergeant on 15 July 1916 and to Sergeant on 4 August 1916. He was wounded in action at Vignacourt, France on 7 November 1916 and evacuated to England for medical treatment. On recovery, he re-joined the 50th Battalion in Belgium on 12 September 1917 and was awarded a Military Medal for bravery in operations near Zonnebeke on 26 September 1917. After being promoted to Second Lieutenant on 10 October 1917, he attended a bombing school near Albert, France and was accidentally killed while gathering unexploded bombs on an old battlefield.

    "description": "An aerial oblique photograph of part of the Somme battlefield looking east, taken from above a 500-yard map square identified as 'O.17.c' on a British 1:40,000 scale military map 'Sheet 28'. The photograph has been keyed by six rays to features on a section of this map oriented in the same direction. The angle of the oblique judged from the recognisable features (Groenelinde Cab.(Cabt.) as notated on the photograph, as well as Junction Buildings and Bang Fm. as notated on the map) appears to indicate aircraft and not balloon photography, aircraft oblique photographs being taken from an altitude of from 1,000 to 1,500 feet, while balloon altitude was generally from 3,000 to 4,000 feet. The 'English' (British) front line is indicated by the third ray from the left and the German trench system lies just forward of  Copse Farm as indicated by the fourth ray from the left. The map from which the section was taken is a conventional British military terrain map based on the Belgian national survey. It identifies some of the original farms by English names eg. Tool Farm, Centre Farm, Bomb Farm and Copse Farm.  The large numbers on the map - 17, 18 and 13 - indicate the centres of 1,000 yard squares, thus the photograph covers portions of all three squares. The photograph, dated while 1st Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (I ANZAC), comprising 1st, 2nd and 5th Australian Divisions,  was out of the line on a four-month rest period (May - September 1917), may have been taken, with many other photographs, to assist in preliminary planning for the Menin Road battle which commenced on 20 September 1917. This would accord with the source of the photograph being Second Lieutenant (2Lt) R.S.Demaine of the 6th Battalion, an infantry unit of 1st Division, I ANZAC, which took part in that battle.

After being bogged and abandoned on the battlefield it was recovered on 14 July 1918 by the 26th Battalion and a British Royal Armoured Corps unit. Evidence of this recovery can be seen by the still attached metal tow cables attached to the front of the Mephisto and looped around the Nordenfelt 57 mm gun. The hand written signs on the side of the tank read: \"Captured by 26th Batt, A.I.F.\" and \"Salved by 1st G C Coy 5th Bde Tanks.\" (See also P01835.080)",

An 18 year old hall porter with service in the Militia with the 47th Infantry prior to enlisting in the AIF on 13 July 1915, he embarked for overseas with the 7th Reinforcements from Melbourne on 26 November 1915 aboard HMAT Commonwealth (A73). After arriving in Egypt he transferred to the 58th Battalion and then to the 59th Battalion and went with the latter to France in June 1916. Pte Windram was killed in action at Fromelles on 19 July 1916 and is buried in the VC Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial at Fromelles, France. V.C. Corner Cemetery is the only uniquely Australian cemetery on the Western Front. It was formed after the Armistice and contains the graves of 410 Australian soldiers who were killed during the Battle of Fromelles in July 1916 and whose bodies were found on the battlefield. As none of the bodies could be identified, it was decided not to mark the individual graves, but to record on a memorial the names of all the Australian soldiers who were killed in the engagement and whose graves are not known. This is one of a series of photographs taken by the Darge Photographic Company which had the concession to take photographs at the Broadmeadows and Seymour army camps during the First World War. In the 1930s, the Australian War Memorial purchased the original glass negatives from Algernon Darge, along with the photographers' notebooks. The notebooks contain brief details, usually a surname or unit name, for each negative.",

Hangard wood is seen in the distance. Near the enemy lines may be noticed a derelict British tank, which formed an enemy machine gun post; a German cooker, and a smashed aeroplane, each an important land mark to the front line troops.  Caption approved by CEW Bean and published with image at page 311, Vol V of Official History of Australia in the War of 1914-1918 reads:    \"The view is south-east from Villers Bretonneux.  In the distance on left are Monument Wood and the poplars along the Demuin road; beyond these Lancer Wood.  The advance of the 36th Battalion started from the valley immediately south of the town and was directed on both sides of Monument Wood. (The trenches seen on the plateau did not then exist, the front having lain a mile beyond them)\".      The image illustrates Captain Bean's  meticulous approach to  documenting the war .  As a matter of routine he would visit a battlefield as soon as practicable and direct AWRS photographers to important points    In this example the importance of the image is lost without its developed caption and that it was taken  \"six weeks after the battle of the afternoon of the 4th of April 1918\"",

    "description": "Outdoor portrait of unidentified members of C Company, 35th Battalion in training camp. An indigenous serviceman holding a bugle and standing to the right, is likely to be 6440 Private Thomas James Walker. The 35th Battalion was formed in December 1915 in Newcastle, New South Wales. The bulk of the battalion's recruits were drawn from the Newcastle region and thus it was dubbed \"Newcastle's Own\". The 35th Battalion was a part of the 9th Brigade of the 3rd Australian Division. It left Sydney, bound for the United Kingdom in May 1916. Arriving there in early July, the battalion spent the next four months training. It crossed to France in late November, and moved into the trenches of the Western Front for the first time on 26 November. The battalion had to wait until the emphasis of British and Dominion operations switched to the Ypres Sector of Belgium in mid-1917 to take part in its first major battle; this was the battle of Messines, launched on 7 June. The 35th's next major battle was around Passchendaele on 12 October. Heavy rain, though, had deluged the battlefield, and thick mud tugged at the advancing troops and fouled their weapons. The battle was a disaster for the 35th; 508 men crossed the start line but only 90 remained unwounded at the end.",

A farmer and blacksmith of Allambee South, near Mirboo North in South Gippsland, Victoria, he enlisted on 1 March 1916 aged 21 years and 3 months.  He was attached to the 10th Field Company, Engineers, and in April 1916 he transferred to the Service Corps reinforcements.  In August 1916, at Broadmeadows, Victoria, he was transferred to the 21st Reinforcements of the 5th Battalion, sailing from Melbourne on A71 HMAT Nestor on 2 October 1916.  After training in England, Robert arrived in France in February 1917, joining the 5th Battalion at the front at the Hindenburg Line and later at Bullecourt. On 20 September 1917 the battalion was in the main attacking force on the first day of the battle of Menin Road, (Third Battle of Ypres), in Belgium. The battalion achieved its objective about 1km from the start line within a few hours and dug in to defend the line. Later that  day, as a member of 15 Platoon D Company, Robert was manning a Lewis machine gun with Corporal William Mazelin near Black Watch Corner in front of Polygon Wood and about 250  yards behind the front line then occupied by 7th and 8th Battalions.  They were defending against an expected German counter attack when a bursting shell killed them both. They were buried on the battlefield alongside others of the same battalion killed in action.  Both Robert and Corporal Mazelin have no known grave and they are commemorated on the Ypres (Menin Gate) Memorial, Belgium.",

    "description": "Studio portrait of Lieutenant Arthur Ernest Streeton, Official War Artist. Streeton had been a member of the Heidelberg school of artists in Melbourne before travelling to England. He was one of a number of artists, including fellow Australians George Coates, Tom Roberts and A Henry Fullwood, who were too old to enlist for active service, but who volunteered to work as orderlies with the Royal Army Medical Corps at the 3rd London General Hospital at Wandsworth. After his discharge as medically unfit, Streeton lobbied for the establishment of an Australian war art scheme. He was offered a commission by the Canadian government but declined, preferring to work for Australia. In 1918 while based in London, he was appointed by the Australian War Memorial as an official war artist and travelled to France to record the involvement of Australians in the battles taking place along the Somme River. During the period of his employment he produced ten paintings and eighty-six drawings that are held by the Memorial. These were all executed in the years 1918 and 1919. The Memorial later purchased his painting 'HMS Renown, Sydney Harbour' painted in 1922, and commissioned several large paintings of significant wartime subjects. Streeton worked mostly around the Somme battlefields until mid-August 1918, when he returned to London. His drawings, watercolours and paintings show the AIF headquarters at St Gratien, Glisy and Heilly, the dressing stations at Villers-Bretonneux, landscape studies and scenes of wrecked machinery. In October and November, Streeton returned to France, again with the 2nd Division. This time his works concentrated on the destruction around Peronne. Streeton completed his contract as an official war artist with 'The Somme Valley above Corbie', a large landscape showing the opening stages of the third battle of the Somme. Streeton returned to Australia in 1920, a famous and popular artist. He was knighted for his services to art in 1937 and died at Olinda, Victoria, in 1943.",

After his discharge as medically unfit, Streeton lobbied for the establishment of an Australian war art scheme. He was offered a commission by the Canadian government but declined, preferring to work for Australia. In 1918 while based in London, he was appointed by the Australian War Memorial as an official war artist and travelled to France to record the involvement of Australians in the battles taking place along the Somme River. During the period of his employment he produced ten paintings and eighty-six drawings that are held by the Memorial. These were all executed in the years 1918 and 1919. The Memorial later purchased his painting 'HMS Renown, Sydney Harbour' painted in 1922, and commissioned several large paintings of significant wartime subjects. Streeton worked mostly around the Somme battlefields until mid-August 1918, when he returned to London. His drawings, watercolours and paintings show the AIF headquarters at St Gratien, Glisy and Heilly, the dressing stations at Villers-Bretonneux, landscape studies and scenes of wrecked machinery.

    "description": "Informal portrait probably of 6592 Private (Pte) Robert Jeadon Smith, 5th Battalion.  A farmer and blacksmith of Allambee South, near Mirboo North in South Gippsland, Victoria, he enlisted on 1 March 1916 aged 21 years.  He was attached to the 10th Field Company, Engineers, and in April 1916 he transferred to the Service Corps reinforcements.  In August 1916, at Broadmeadows, Victoria, he was transferred to the 21st Reinforcements of the 5th Battalion, and embarked from Melbourne aboard HMAT Nestor (A71) on 2 October 1916.  After training in England, Robert arrived in France in February 1917, joining the 5th Battalion at the front at the Hindenburg Line and later at Bullecourt. On 20 September 1917 the battalion was in the main attacking force on the first day of the battle of Menin Road, (Third Battle of Ypres), in Belgium. The battalion achieved its objective about 1km from the start line within a few hours and dug in to defend the line. Later that  day, as a member of 15 Platoon D Company, Robert was manning a Lewis machine gun with Corporal William Mazelin near Black Watch Corner in front of Polygon Wood and about 250 yards behind the front line then occupied by 7th and 8th Battalions.  They were defending against an expected German counter attack when a bursting shell killed them both. They were buried on the battlefield alongside others of the same battalion killed in action.  Both Robert and Corporal Mazelin have no known grave and they are commemorated on the Ypres (Menin Gate) Memorial, Belgium.  This is one of a series of photographs taken by the Darge Photographic Company which had the concession to take photographs at the Broadmeadows and Seymour army camps during the First World War. In the 1930s, the Australian War Memorial purchased the original glass negatives from Algernon Darge, along with the photographers' notebooks. The notebooks contain brief details, usually a surname or unit name, for each negative.",

    "description": "Front view of a bust of John Treloar, sculpted by Web Gilbert in the 1920s. After completing his schooling in 1911, Treloar joined the Department of Defence as a military staff clerk. He enlisted in the AIF in August 1914 and, after a period of training, served on Gallipoli as a staff sergeant. Having been on the peninsula since April, Treloar was evacuated in September suffering from enteric fever and was eventually invalided to Australia. Treloar's health recovered and he resumed his service, this time as a lieutenant with the role of equipment officer in No 1 Squadron of the Australian Flying Corps. In July 1916 he was transferred to France as confidential clerk to Brigadier General Brudenell White at the 1st Anzac Corps Headquarters. In May 1917 he began the work that would dominate the rest of his life when he was selected to organise the fledgling Australian War Records Section with the rank of captain. The section's work would form the basis of much of the Australian War Memorial's collection. Six days before the end of the war he married Clarissa Aldridge in London and, in December 1918, was promoted to major. The war over, Treloar began the painstaking work of sorting and categorising the large body of war documents under his charge, laying the basis for the collection still used by historians and researchers to the present day. Devoted to the Australian War Memorial, Treloar became the institution's director in 1920, working tirelessly for the more than three decades and living next to his office. At times credited with keeping the Memorial going, he also ensured that the Memorial took over the publication and distribution of the 12 volume official history of Australia in the First World War, when the series encountered difficulties in the 1930s. Treloar left his position at the Memorial during the Second World War when he was made head of the Department of Information. He took charge of the Military History Section at Army Headquarters and began the process of establishing a collection of Second World War relics and documents. He returned to the Memorial after the war and was described by one employee as the most complex character he had ever met. For the most part, however, he was aloof from his staff, working alone in his office. Unwilling to delegate, Treloar worked punishing hours until his death from an intestinal haemorrhage on 28 January 1952. The bust's sculptor, Web Gilbert, was largely self-taught and established his own teaching studio and foundry in Melbourne before moving to London in 1914, aged 47. After working in a munitions factory, he reluctantly joined the Australian War Records Section in 1918. Appointed head sculptor for the proposed diorama scheme, he spent 13 months touring battlefields where Australians had fought. From 1920 to 1925 he worked on the Second Division AIF memorial at Mont St Quentin, and took on other commissions, notably the Light Horse memorial at Port Said, Egypt, which was finished after his death in 1925 by Paul Montford and Bertram McKennal, and re-created by Ray Ewers after it was damaged in the Suez uprising in 1956.",

The war over, Treloar began the painstaking work of sorting and categorising the large body of war documents under his charge, laying the basis for the collection still used by historians and researchers to the present day. Devoted to the Australian War Memorial, Treloar became the institution's director in 1920, working tirelessly for the more than three decades and living next to his office. At times credited with keeping the Memorial going, he also ensured that the Memorial took over the publication and distribution of the 12 volume official history of Australia in the First World War, when the series encountered difficulties in the 1930s. Treloar left his position at the Memorial during the Second World War when he was made head of the Department of Information. He took charge of the Military History Section at Army Headquarters and began the process of establishing a collection of Second World War relics and documents. He returned to the Memorial after the war and was described by one employee as the most complex character he had ever met. For the most part, however, he was aloof from his staff, working alone in his office. Unwilling to delegate, Treloar worked punishing hours until his death from an intestinal haemorrhage on 28 January 1952. The bust's sculptor, Web Gilbert, was largely self-taught and established his own teaching studio and foundry in Melbourne before moving to London in 1914, aged 47. After working in a munitions factory, he reluctantly joined the Australian War Records Section in 1918. Appointed head sculptor for the proposed diorama scheme, he spent 13 months touring battlefields where Australians had fought. From 1920 to 1925 he worked on the Second Division AIF memorial at Mont St Quentin, and took on other commissions, notably the Light Horse memorial at Port Said, Egypt, which was finished after his death in 1925 by Paul Montford and Bertram McKennal, and re-created by Ray Ewers after it was damaged in the Suez uprising in 1956.",

    "description": "Portrait of Lieutenant (Lt) James Lionel Montague Sandy, Australian Flying Corps (AFC).  Lt Sandy was originally appointed to the AIF in 1914 as a Second Lieutenant in the Australian Field Artillery and was an original member of the 1st Field Artillery Brigade.  He sailed in the first convoy to Egypt on board the HMT Argyllshire (A8) and served in the 3rd Battery at Cape Helles on the Gallipoli Peninsula, until he was wounded in July 1915 and sent for treatment to England.  His application to join the Flying Corps was accepted in 1916 and he returned to Australia arriving on 21 June 1916 to undergo pilot training at Point Cook. After completing his initial flying training he embarked on the HMT Ulysses and landed in England on 28 December 1916.  Training continued at the 23rd Training Wing, Royal Flying Corps (RFC) until No 69 Squadron (Australian) RFC (later No 3 Squadron, AFC) was sent to France with Lt Sandy as the Deputy Flight Commander of A Flight. No 3 Squadron, an Army co-operation squadron, was equipped with RE8's and initially stationed at Savy, and in 1917 at Bailleul, in France. On 17 December 1917, Lt Sandy and his observer, 559 Sergeant (Sgt) Henry  Francis Hughes, of South Yarra, were flying over the battlefield ranging  an 8 inch howitzer for the 151 British Siege Battery when their RE8, serial number A3816,  was attacked by six DVa Albatros Scouts between Deulemont and Armentieres. In the ensuing air battle the pilot of one German aircraft, Leutnant Rudolph Clauss, was wounded and forced to land in the lines of the 21st Australian Infantry Battalion where he was captured by the Australians, while in the battle above, Lt Sandy was joined by another 3 Squadron RE8 flown by Captain (Capt) E J Jones and Lt K C Hodgson.  The two RE8s fought the Germans for about ten minutes until a third RE8 flown by Lt's H N Wrigley and J R Blair appeared and the five remaining German aircraft retired. Capt Jones flew close to Lt Sandy's aircraft, still cruising normally on its 'beat', and concluded they were continuing their work spotting for the howitzer battery.  Radio contact with Lt Sandy's aircraft ceased and the aircraft disappeared from its allotted area. The squadron tried to trace the aircraft and its crew without success until they were notified by No 12 Stationary Hospital at St Pol, a straight line distance of 75 kilometres south west from the scene of the aerial combat with the German aircraft, that an RE8 had crashed 8 kilometres north east of St Pol, near the Bruay to St Pol road. Lt Sandy and Sgt Hughes had been killed by a single armour piercing bullet that had first passed through Sgt Hughes and then Lt Sandy, killing them both.  The aircraft was at full throttle and continued to fly until it ran out of fuel and crashed. Both men are buried in the St Pol Communal Cemetery Extension, Lt Sandy in grave H8 and Sgt Hughes in H10.  While still missing, Lt Sandy had been recommended for an immediate award of the Military Cross and Sgt Hughes the Distinguished Conduct Medal; the recommendations were not approved.  The Albatros that was forced down behind the Australian lines, serial number D.5390/17, was salvaged and later claimed by Australia and is now in the collection of the Australian War Memorial.",
