    "description": "Men from Australia's rural districts have \"joined up for the duration\" in such large numbers that the production of the pastoral and farming industries was seriously threatened. Country and city girls have helped to solve the labour problem. This series of photos shows three Melbourne society girls at work on a 2000 acre farm near Stawell, Victoria. They are members of the Land Girls' Army, and they also are serving \"for the duration\". So adept have they become that their employer wishes it were for longer. Australian Womens Land Army. Helen McGregor, after 12 months experience, has earned her place in the team, where sheep are concerned. It is none too easy to count sheep as they stream through a gate gate, but Miss McGregor seldom makes a mistake. One of a series of photographs taken on 17 and 18 September 1941 at \"Killara\", near Stawell, Victoria, by the Department of Information which were later used to promote and recruit for the Australian Women's Land Army (AWLA). Three members of the Country Women's Association Land Army (CWALA), Helen McGregor, Carmen Virgoe and Flora Hendy, were working on the property and were depicted undertaking a variety of manual tasks. The CWALA was formed in June 1940.",

She was transferred to Canberra on 25 August 1941, where she worked for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR, later known as CSIRO). She was assigned to work at the Dickson farm (now the site of Downer Primary School) where blue gum trees (Eucalyptus globulus), rubber trees (Heavea brasiliensis) and opium poppies (Papaver somniferum) were grown. She worked Monday to Friday from 8.30 to 5.40 plus Saturday mornings and her main duties were planting, weeding and turning the soil with a hoe. Her uniform was provided by the government and included a skirt, jacket and hat for formal occassions and stockings, shoes, overalls, shirts, boots and a jumper for working. She was initially accommodated at Beauchamp House and was charged 30 shillings per week for lodgings which after tax left her with two pounds net per week. Her mode of transport was by bicycle which she had brought with her from Sydney and she would cycle to and from work every day in all types of weather. Later she moved to Gorman House which was a better arrangement than her previous lodgings. In 1943 Lesley met the wife of the United States President, Eleanor Roosevelt, who was visiting Canberra and had requested to meet some of the women in the land army.  Lesley remained in Canberra until 1988 when she and her husband retired to the Sunshine Coast in 1988.",
